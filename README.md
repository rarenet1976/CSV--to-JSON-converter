# CSV-JSON-Converter
 
The following Python script allows CSV files to be instantly converted into JSON files.  JSON formatted files are often necessary in data related projects.

Our use case for converting to JSON was to import batch records into a DynamoDb table.

We did not include error handling, as this was only used for test data, however feel free to modify.

To use this simple script, you only need the following modules installed in your Python environment:
1. [JSON Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) (import JSON)
2. [OS Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) (import OS)
3. [CSV Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) (import CSV)

Its benefit lets users quickly convert and build CSV files for any project use case.
